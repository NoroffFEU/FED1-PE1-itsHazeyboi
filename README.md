## Description

For our first year exam we were tasked with building a front end application for a blogpost website, where you could choose / make up the client yourself. Here we would be handling and building most of the website dynamically using a supplied API from noroff and javascript to process the logic.
Through a combination of localstorage, url key & value pairs, and lots more I was able to build a pretty sleek and good looking blogging site that builds most things dynamically in my ever so humble opinion. The site features the ability to log in to a user, to register a user and also it will not let you edit / post or be on pages you're not allowed to have access to if you are not logged in as an administrator / owner. This project has taught me lots about handling of API's in general and how to use them in a practical setting, so should I want to make something of the same sort later, I will now have something to refer to experience from. All in all, very happy with how it turned out.
